# SOC-Home-Lab-Endpoint-Detection-C2-Simulation-and-Incident-Investigation
Built a SOC-style home lab to generate and investigate realistic attacker behavior. Used endpoint telemetry to detect credential access activity and build custom detection rules. 

Project Overview

This project involved building a small SOC-style home lab to simulate real-world attacker behavior and observe it from a defensive perspective. I configured a Windows endpoint with Sysmon and LimaCharlie EDR, generated attacker activity using a C2 framework (Sliver), and investigated the resulting telemetry to identify malicious behavior.
